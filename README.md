# Multi-User-Tracking-using-Maps
This application should give the user the positioning of all their friends travelling to the same destination.

This application predominantly uses the GMaps API for communication.
A host will be able to generate a code which will contain the common destination where all his/her friends are intending to travel.
Once the code is entered, all the members in the room can see the relative positioning of all the members who've embarked on this journey.

Uses
This is a novel application that will enable users to track the real time location of all of their friends and make the journey a comfortable one.
